	abstract = {Assist-as-needed control with a soft robotic hand glove for active rehabilitation is studied in this work. There are two resources of the grasping force, the robotic glove and the subject. Compared with traditional passive rehabilitation where the grasping force is merely provided by a robotic hand rehabilitation device (such as hand exoskeleton, robotic glove), assist-as-needed control accounts for the user contribute to performing grasping tasks collaboratively. In this control method, the human muscle strength for grasping is estimated through the myoelectrical signals of the human forearm collected by the MYO armband. A neural network is used for the recognition of human-object contact estimation. The assist-as-needed control is finally implemented to assist humans in grasping tasks. Experiment results on a soft robotic glove show the effectiveness of the proposed assistive control method.},

	abstract = {Dexterous manipulation, often facilitated by multi-fingered robotic hands, holds solid impact for real-world applications. Soft robotic hands, due to their compliant nature, offer flexibility and adaptability during object grasping and manipulation. Yet, benefits come with challenges, particularly in the control development for finger coordination. Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be employed to train object-specific in-hand manipulation policies, but limiting adaptability and generalizability. We introduce a Continual Policy Distillation (CPD) framework to acquire a versatile controller for in-hand manipulation, to rotate different objects in shape and size within a four-fingered soft gripper. The framework leverages Policy Distillation (PD) to transfer knowledge from expert policies to a continually evolving student policy network. Exemplar-based rehearsal methods are then integrated to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enhance generalization. The performance of the CPD framework over various replay strategies demonstrates its effectiveness in consolidating knowledge from multiple experts and achieving versatile and adaptive behaviours for in-hand manipulation tasks.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of robot-assisted movement training with conventional techniques for the rehabilitation of upper-limb motor function after stroke.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial, 6-month follow-up.
SETTING: A Department of Veterans Affairs rehabilitation research and development center.
PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive sample of 27 subjects with chronic hemiparesis ({\textgreater}6mo after cerebrovascular accident) randomly allocated to group.
INTERVENTIONS: All subjects received twenty-four 1-hour sessions over 2 months. Subjects in the robot group practiced shoulder and elbow movements while assisted by a robot manipulator. Subjects in the control group received neurodevelopmental therapy (targeting proximal upper limb function) and 5 minutes of exposure to the robot in each session.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fugl-Meyer assessment of motor impairment, FIMtrade mark instrument, and biomechanic measures of strength and reaching kinematics. Clinical evaluations were performed by a therapist blinded to group assignments.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the robot group had larger improvements in the proximal movement portion of the Fugl-Meyer test after 1 month of treatment (P{\textless}.05) and also after 2 months of treatment (P{\textless}.05). The robot group had larger gains in strength (P{\textless}.02) and larger increases in reach extent (P{\textless}.01) after 2 months of treatment. At the 6-month follow-up, the groups no longer differed in terms of the Fugl-Meyer test (P{\textgreater}.30); however, the robot group had larger improvements in the FIM (P{\textless}.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional treatment, robot-assisted movements had advantages in terms of clinical and biomechanical measures. Further research into the use of robotic manipulation for motor rehabilitation is justified.},

	abstract = {Traditional hand rehabilitation devices present a challenge in providing personalized training that can lead to finger movements exceeding the safe range, resulting in secondary injuries. To address this issue, we introduce a soft rehabilitation training glove with the function of safety and personalization, which can allow patients to select training modes based on rehabilitation and provide real-time monitoring, as well as feedback on finger movement data. The inner glove is equipped with bending sensors to access the maximum/minimum angle of finger movement and to provide data for the safety of rehabilitation training. The outer glove contains flexible drivers, which can drive fingers for different modes of rehabilitation training. As a result, the rehabilitation glove can drive five fingers to achieve maximum extension/flexion angles of 15.65°/85.97°, 15.34°/89.53°, 16.78°/94.27°, 15.59°/88.82°, and 16.73°/88.65°, from thumb to little finger, respectively, and the rehabilitation training frequency can reach six times per minute. The safety evaluation result indicated an error within ±6.5° of the target-motion threshold. The reliability assessment yielded a high-intra-class correlation coefficient value (0.7763–0.9996). Hence, the rehabilitation glove can achieve targeted improvement in hand function while ensuring safety.},

The advent of rehabilitation robotics and automated assessment systems can ease this burden by assisting in the rehabilitation of patients with a high level of recovery. This assistance will enable medical professionals to either better provide for patients with severe injuries or treat more patients. It also translates into financial assistance as well in the long run. This paper demonstrated an automated assessment system for in-home rehabilitation utilizing a data glove, a mobile application, and machine learning algorithms. The system can be used by poststroke patients with a high level of recovery to assess their performance. Furthermore, this assessment can be sent to a medical professional for supervision. Additionally, a comparison between two machine learning classifiers was performed on their assessment of physical exercises. The proposed system has an accuracy of 85\% (±5.1\%) with careful feature and classifier selection.},

The validation of these devices presents critical aspects, since the system performance must be assessed analyzing the movement performed by the subject limb, i.e., elements outside the device. This paper presents a multi-sensor approach for the validation of an innovative end-effector-based device, comparing different measurement strategies for evaluating the system effectiveness in imposing an expected training. The study was performed monitoring the movement induced by the device on the upper limb of a young male healthy subject during a set of fictitious rehabilitation sessions. The kinematic structure of the device is characterized by a compact differential mechanism with two degrees of freedom. A sequence of repetitions of a planar reaching pattern was analyzed as illustrative training task. A kinematic model of subject and system was developed, and the kinematics of a set of specific landmark points on the subject limb was evaluated. Data obtained from two measurement systems were compared: (1) an optoelectronic system with two cameras and eight skin passive markers, and (2) two triaxial accelerometers. Results were analyzed in MATLAB and R environment, revealing a high repeatability of the limb movement. Although both the measurement systems allow evaluating the acceleration of subject’s arm and forearm, accelerometers should be preferred for punctual analysis, like components optimizations, whereas optical markers provide a general overview of the system, particularly suitable for the functional design process.},

The glove is lightweight, easy to don, and generates sufficient hand closing force to assist with activities of daily living. Device efficiency was examined through a characterization of the power transmission elements, and output force production was observed to be linear in both cylindrical and pinch grasp configurations. We further show that, as a result of the synergy-inspired actuation strategy, the glove only slightly alters the distribution of forces across the fingers, compared to a natural, unassisted grasping pattern. Finally, a preliminary case study was conducted using a participant suffering from an incomplete spinal cord injury (C7). It was found that through the use of the glove, the participant was able to achieve a 50\% performance improvement (from four to six blocks) in a standard Box and Block test.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The debilitating effects on hand function from a number of a neurologic disorders has given rise to the development of rehabilitative robotic devices aimed at restoring hand function in these patients. To combat the shortcomings of previous traditional robotics, soft robotics are rapidly emerging as an alternative due to their inherent safety, less complex designs, and increased potential for portability and efficacy. While several groups have begun designing devices, there are few devices that have progressed enough to provide clinical evidence of their design's therapeutic abilities. Therefore, a global review of devices that have been previously attempted could facilitate the development of new and improved devices in the next step towards obtaining clinical proof of the rehabilitative effects of soft robotics in hand dysfunction.
METHODS: A literature search was performed in SportDiscus, Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles related to the design of soft robotic devices for hand rehabilitation. A framework of the key design elements of the devices was developed to ease the comparison of the various approaches to building them. This framework includes an analysis of the trends in portability, safety features, user intent detection methods, actuation systems, total DOF, number of independent actuators, device weight, evaluation metrics, and modes of rehabilitation.
RESULTS: In this study, a total of 62 articles representing 44 unique devices were identified and summarized according to the framework we developed to compare different design aspects. By far, the most common type of device was that which used a pneumatic actuator to guide finger flexion/extension. However, the remainder of our framework elements yielded more heterogeneous results. Consequently, those results are summarized and the advantages and disadvantages of many design choices as well as their rationales were highlighted.
CONCLUSION: The past 3 years has seen a rapid increase in the development of soft robotic devices for hand rehabilitative applications. These mostly preclinical research prototypes display a wide range of technical solutions which have been highlighted in the framework developed in this analysis. More work needs to be done in actuator design, safety, and implementation in order for these devices to progress to clinical trials. It is our goal that this review will guide future developers through the various design considerations in order to develop better devices for patients with hand impairments.},

This paper presents a review of active hand exoskeleton technologies, over the past decade, for rehabilitation, assistance, augmentation, and haptic devices. Hand exoskeletons are still an active research field due to challenges that engineers face and are trying to solve. Each hand exoskeleton has certain requirements to fulfil to achieve their aims. These requirements have been extracted and categorized into two sections: general and specific, to give a common platform for developing future devices. Since this is still a developing area, the requirements are also shaped according to the advances in the field. Technical challenges, such as size requirements, weight, ergonomics, rehabilitation, actuators, and sensors are all due to the complex anatomy and biomechanics of the hand. The hand is one of the most complex structures in the human body; therefore, to understand certain design approaches, the anatomy and biomechanics of the hand are addressed in this paper. The control of these devices is also an arising challenge due to the implementation of intelligent systems and new rehabilitation techniques. This includes intention detection techniques (electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), admittance) and estimating applied assistance. Therefore, this paper summarizes the technology in a systematic approach and reviews the state of the art of active hand exoskeletons with a focus on rehabilitation and assistive devices.},

	abstract = {Background. No strongly clinical evidence about the use of hand robot-assisted therapy in stroke patients was demonstrated. This preliminary observer study was aimed at evaluating the efficacy of intensive robot-assisted therapy in hand function recovery, in the early phase after a stroke onset. Methods. Seven acute ischemic stroke patients at their first-ever stroke were enrolled. Treatment was performed using Amadeo robotic system (Tyromotion GmbH Graz, Austria). Each participant received, in addition to inpatients standard rehabilitative treatment, 20 sessions of robotic treatment for 4 consecutive weeks (5 days/week). Each session lasted for 40 minutes. The exercises were carried out as follows: passive modality (5 minutes), passive/plus modality (5 minutes), assisted therapy (10 minutes), and balloon (10 minutes). The following impairment and functional evaluations, Fugl-Meyer Scale (FM), Medical Research Council Scale for Muscle Strength (hand flexor and extensor muscles) (MRC), Motricity Index (MI), and modified Ashworth Scale for wrist and hand muscles (AS), were performed at the beginning (T0), after 10 sessions (T1), and at the end of the treatment (T2). The strength hand flexion and extension performed by Robot were assessed at T0 and T2. The Barthel Index and COMP (performance and satisfaction subscale) were assessed at T0 and T2. Results. Clinical improvements were found in all patients. No dropouts were recorded during the treatment and all subjects fulfilled the protocol. Evidence of a significant improvement was demonstrated by the Friedman test for the MRC (P {\textless} 0.0123). Evidence of an improvement was demonstrated for AS, FM, and MI. Conclusions. This original rehabilitation treatment could contribute to increase the hand motor recovery in acute stroke patients. The simplicity of the treatment, the lack of side effects, and the first positive results in acute stroke patients support the recommendations to extend the clinical trial of this treatment, in association with physiotherapy and/or occupational therapy.},

The training consisted of repetitive hand and finger flexions and extensions against various loads and was carried out twice daily during 15-min periods. Grip strength (p {\textless} 0.006), peak force of isometric hand extensions (p {\textless} 0.05), peak acceleration (p {\textless} 0.05) of isotonic hand extensions as well as contraction velocities as indicators of motor performance significantly improved during the training period. In contrast to the standardized training of hand and finger movements, therapeutic strategies following the Bobath concept aim at reducing enhanced muscle tone without reinforcing the activity in centrally paretic distal muscle groups directly. Patients undergoing this treatment approach alone did not experience a significant improvement in the motor capacity of the hand. Therefore, the results of the present study emphasize the importance of frequent movement repetition for the motor rehabilitation of the centrally paretic hand and challenge conventional physiotherapeutic strategies that focus on spasticity reduction instead of early initiation of active movements.},

Objective
To assess the feasibility of a new stroke rehabilitation therapy for the hemiparetic hand.
Design
Case series. Pre- and postintervention assessment with 1- and 3-month follow-ups.
Setting
Clinical research laboratory of a large public hospital.
Participants
Three subjects with chronic ({\textgreater}6mo postcerebrovascular accident) upper-extremity hemiplegia.
Intervention
Subjects used an electric stimulator to cause the paretic hand extensor muscles to contract and thereby open the hand. Subjects controlled the intensity of the stimulation, and thus the degree of hand opening, by volitionally opening the unimpaired contralateral hand, which was detected by an instrumented glove. For 6 weeks, subjects used the stimulator to perform active repetitive hand-opening exercises 2 hours daily at home and functional tasks 1.5 hours twice a week in the laboratory.
Main Outcome Measures
Maximum voluntary finger extension, maximum voluntary isometric finger-extension moment, finger-movement control, and box and block test (BBT) score at pre- and posttreatment and at 1 month and 3 months posttreatment.
Results
Maximum voluntary finger extension increased from baseline to end of treatment and from the end of treatment to 1-month follow-up in 2 subjects. Maximum voluntary isometric finger-extension moment, finger-movement control, and BBT score increased from baseline to the end of treatment and from the end of treatment to 1-month follow-up in all 3 subjects. The improvements generally declined at 3 months.
Conclusions
The results suggest a positive effect on motor impairment, meriting further investigation of the intervention.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine whether symptomatic arthritis in middle age predicts the earlier onset of functional difficulties (difficulty with activities of daily living (ADLs) and walking) that are associated with loss of independence in older persons. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal study. SETTING: The Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative sample of persons aged 50 to 62 at baseline who were followed for 10 years. PARTICIPANTS: Seven thousand five hundred forty-three subjects with no difficulty in mobility or ADL function at baseline. MEASUREMENTS: Arthritis was measured at baseline according to self-report. The primary outcome was time to persistent difficulty in one of five ADLs or mobility (walking several blocks or up a flight of stairs). Difficulty with ADLs or mobility was assessed according to subject interview every 2 years. Analyses were adjusted for other comorbid conditions, body mass index, exercise, and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Twenty-nine percent of subjects reported arthritis at baseline. Subjects with arthritis were more likely to develop persistent difficulty in mobility or ADL function over 10 years of follow-up (34\% vs 18\%, adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.63, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.43–1.86). When each component of the primary outcome was assessed separately, arthritis was also associated with persistent difficulty in mobility (30\% vs 16\%, adjusted HR=1.55, 95\% CI=1.41–1.71) and persistent difficulty in ADL function (13\% vs 5\%, adjusted HR=1.85, 95\% CI=1.58–2.16). CONCLUSION: Middle-aged persons who report a history of arthritis are more likely to develop mobility and ADL difficulties as they enter old age. This finding highlights the need to develop interventions and treatments that take a life-course approach to preventing the disabling effect of arthritis.},

	abstract = {Purpose Hand motor dysfunction has seriously reduced people’s quality of life. The purpose of this paper is to solve this problem; different soft exoskeleton robots have been developed because of their good application prospects in assistance. In this paper, a new soft hand exoskeleton is designed to help people conduct rehabilitation training. Design/methodology/approach The proposed soft exoskeleton is an under-actuated cable-driven mechanism, which optimizes the force transmission path and many local structures. Specifically, the path of force transmission is optimized and cables are wound around cam-shaped spools to prevent cables lose during fingers movement. Besides, a pre-tightening system is presented to adjust the preload force of the cable-tube. Moreover, a passive brake mechanism is proposed to prevent the cables from falling off the spools when the remote side is relaxed. Findings Finally, three control strategies are proposed to assist in rehabilitation training. Results show that the average correlation coefficient of trajectory tracking is 90.99\% and this exoskeleton could provide steady clamping force up to 35 N, which could meet the demands of activities in daily living. Surface electromyography (sEMG)-based intention recognition method is presented to complete assistance and experiments are conducted to prove the effectiveness of the assisted grasping method by monitoring muscle activation, finger angle and interactive force. Research limitations/implications However, the system should be further optimized in terms of hardware and control to reduce delays. In addition, more clinical trials should be conducted to evaluate the effect of the proposed rehabilitation strategies. Social implications May improve the ability of hemiplegic patients to live independently. Originality/value A novel under-actuated soft hand exoskeleton structure is proposed, and an sEMG-based auxiliary grasping control strategy is presented to help hemiplegic patients conduct rehabilitation training.},

The segmented structure of the actuator is designed according to the anatomy of human fingers, i.e., three flexible segments for finger joints and four inflexible segments for finger metacarpal and phalanges, which makes the actuator fit with finger better than those of homogenous structure. The number of inflatable chambers in the flexible segment can be designed according to range of motion (ROM) of the corresponding joint. To improve the air tightness of the actuator, an inner bladder is embedded into chambers. To predict the passive bending degree and grasping force of human fingers driven by the glove, a bottom-up model is constructed by using Yeoh's theory of hyperelasticity and Lagrange equations of serial robots. The model is verified by FEM simulations and experiments simultaneously. At last, some passive exercises are presented, which indicates its potential in hand rehabilitation.},

The robotic glove leverages soft material actuator technology to safely distribute forces along the length of the finger and provide active flexion and passive extension. These actuators consist of molded elastomeric bladders with anisotropic fiber reinforcements that produce specific bending, twisting, and extending trajectories upon fluid pressurization. In particular, we present a method for customizing a soft actuator to a wearer's biomechanics and demonstrate in a motion capture system that the ranges of motion (ROM) of the two are nearly equivalent. The active ROM of the glove is further evaluated using the Kapandji test. Lastly, in a case study, we present preliminary results of a patient with very weak hand strength performing a timed Box-and-Block test with and without the soft robotic glove.},

Most of the existing hand exoskeletons have focused on either providing a customizable and modular design or making it portable to be used outside the hospital environment. We have developed a design of an exoskeleton glove that combines both of these features in one compact design. This was achieved by using a parameterised CAD design of glove, 3D printing of soft (i.e., compliant) materials, design a bidirectional cable driven spooling system and integrating them together in a modular fashion. The overall weight of the Flexo-glove is 330g including battery and is able to provide 22N pinch force, 48N power grasp force and object grasp size of up to 81mm in diameter. The device has two control modes: intention-sensing via wireless sEMG for assistive mode and externally-directed via an accompanying smartphone application for rehabilitation (repetitive exercise) programs, both managed through Bluetooth communication. The effectiveness of the proposed design is evaluated in performing cylindrical, hook, and pinch grasps on various objects.},

	abstract = {Humans can feel, weigh and grasp diverse objects, and simultaneously infer their material properties while applying the right amount of force—a challenging set of tasks for a modern robot1. Mechanoreceptor networks that provide sensory feedback and enable the dexterity of the human grasp2 remain difficult to replicate in robots. Whereas computer-vision-based robot grasping strategies3–5 have progressed substantially with the abundance of visual data and emerging machine-learning tools, there are as yet no equivalent sensing platforms and large-scale datasets with which to probe the use of the tactile information that humans rely on when grasping objects. Studying the mechanics of how humans grasp objects will complement vision-based robotic object handling. Importantly, the inability to record and analyse tactile signals currently limits our understanding of the role of tactile information in the human grasp itself—for example, how tactile maps are used to identify objects and infer their properties is unknown6. Here we use a scalable tactile glove and deep convolutional neural networks to show that sensors uniformly distributed over the hand can be used to identify individual objects, estimate their weight and explore the typical tactile patterns that emerge while grasping objects. The sensor array (548 sensors) is assembled on a knitted glove, and consists of a piezoresistive film connected by a network of conductive thread electrodes that are passively probed. Using a low-cost (about US\$10) scalable tactile glove sensor array, we record a large-scale tactile dataset with 135,000 frames, each covering the full hand, while interacting with 26 different objects. This set of interactions with different objects reveals the key correspondences between different regions of a human hand while it is manipulating objects. Insights from the tactile signatures of the human grasp—through the lens of an artificial analogue of the natural mechanoreceptor network—can thus aid the future design of prosthetics7, robot grasping tools and human–robot interactions1,8–10.},

Robotic soft gloves have been developed for hand rehabilitation, for ADLs assistance, or sometimes for both. Haptic soft gloves may be applied in virtual reality (VR) applications or to give sensory feedback in combination with prostheses or to control robots. This paper presents an updated review of the state of the art of soft gloves, with a particular focus on actuation, sensing, and control, combined with a detailed analysis of the devices according to their application field. The review is organized on two levels: a prospective review allows the highlighting of the main trends in soft gloves development and applications, and an analytical review performs an in-depth analysis of the technical solutions developed and implemented in the revised scientific research. Additional minor evaluations integrate the analysis, such as a synthetic investigation of the main results in the clinical studies and trials referred in literature which involve soft gloves.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To conduct a survey on the research and development of cable-driven rehabilitation devices (CDRDs). Method: This review searches in the databases of PubMed, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Science Direct, and Google Scholar using various combinations of the following keywords: cable, wire, rehabilitation, assistance, therapy, training, robot, elastic, and pneumatic. Searches in the above databases for references cited by the above-searched references are also conducted to include a larger context of CDRDs. Results: CDRDs are classified into four categories, namely, serial exoskeleton-based, parallel exoskeleton-based, serial end-effector-based, and parallel end-effector-based CDRDs. Each category of CDRDs are further grouped based on the part of the human body to be rehabilitated. All four categories of CDRDs are examined and compared and their advantages and shortcomings are discussed based on popular rehabilitation requirements on weight, adaptability, versatility, misalignment, and safety. Open issues of CDRDs are also discussed. Conclusions: Each category of CDRDs has its own advantages and shortcomings. The selection of a CDRD highly depends on the specific application. Regarding the convenience of setting up a CDRD for rehabilitation, parallel CDRDs usually have better adaptability than serial ones. However, uncertainties come with parallel CDRDs, which makes the control of parallel CDRDs more challenging. Moreover, the strategy of inherent safety has a great potential to further improve the safety of CDRDs.Implications for rehabilitationCDRDs (and general RRDs) can deliver high-intensity training while therapists usually cannot. With up-to-date human-robot interaction techniques (e.g., virtual reality), CDRDs are more interesting and motivating to trainees than conventional manual rehabilitation therapies. CDRDs also provide financial benefits in the long-run. Currently existing RRDs available for clinical practice are mainly designed for the rehabilitation of shoulders, elbows, and knees. Parallel exoskeleton-based CDRDs can also be used for the rehabilitation of many other parts of trainees. Thus, CDRDs extend the coverage of RRDs in rehabilitation. Owing to their simple structures and light weights, CDRDs can be portable and used for rehabilitation at home. In this way, CDRDs can improve the duration and intensity of rehabilitation for those with limited access to rehabilitation institutes. As well known, the higher intensity of training leads to a higher rate of recovery. CDRDs (and general RRDs) can deliver high-intensity training while therapists usually cannot.

To operate this soft wearable glove, we designed the hardware system for SRGs with a flexible strain sensor and force sensor in the loop and introduced a force/position hybrid PID control algorithm to regulate the pressure inputted. Experiment evaluation focused on rehabilitation training gestures; motions and the precise grasping assistance function were executed. The rotating actuator between each finger can supply abduction/adduction motion manner for patients, which will improve rehabilitation effect.

	abstract = {Background Soft-robotic gloves with an assist-as-needed control have the ability to assist daily activities where needed, while stimulating active and highly functional movements within the user’s possibilities. Employment of hand activities with glove support might act as training for unsupported hand function. Objective To evaluate the therapeutic effect of a grip-supporting soft-robotic glove as an assistive device at home during daily activities. Methods This multicentre intervention trial consisted of 3 pre-assessments (averaged if steady state = PRE), one post-assessment (POST), and one follow-up assessment (FU). Participants with chronic hand function limitations were included. Participants used the Carbonhand glove during six weeks in their home environment on their most affected hand. They were free to choose which activities to use the glove with and for how long. The primary outcome measure was grip strength, secondary outcome measures were pinch strength, hand function and glove use time. Results 63 patients with limitations in hand function resulting from various disorders were included. Significant improvements (difference PRE-POST) were found for grip strength (+1.9 kg, CI 0.8 to 3.1; p = 0.002) and hand function, as measured by Jebson-Taylor Hand Function Test (-7.7 s, CI -13.4 to -1.9; p = 0.002) and Action Research Arm Test (+1.0 point, IQR 2.0; p≤0.001). Improvements persisted at FU. Pinch strength improved slightly in all fingers over six-week glove use, however these differences didn’t achieve significance. Participants used the soft-robotic glove for a total average of 33.0 hours (SD 35.3), equivalent to 330 min/week (SD 354) or 47 min/day (SD 51). No serious adverse events occurred. Conclusion The present findings showed that six weeks use of a grip-supporting soft-robotic glove as an assistive device at home resulted in a therapeutic effect on unsupported grip strength and hand function. The glove use time also showed that this wearable, lightweight glove was able to assist participants with the performance of daily tasks for prolonged periods.},

	abstract = {Paralysis caused by stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, or other injuries and medical conditions can significantly impair the hand function. This impacts an individual’s ability to perform manual tasks in activities of daily living (ADL), affecting their independence and psychological well-being. Robotic hand exoskeletons and orthoses have been developed to assist individuals with hand paralysis in conducting ADL; however, existing commercial systems tend to provide basic whole-hand opening and closing motions rather than dexterous manipulation. In this chapter, we document the design of the second prototype of the hand exoskeleton with embedded synergies (HEXOES). This soft glove-based cable-driven robot provides independent actuation of 10 degrees of freedom of the hand using a remote actuator assembly and a lightweight hand component. The hand component, weighing 258 g, actuates the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of each finger and thumb in flexion, with passive extension provided by adjustable springs. Design features were incorporated which aid in donning and doffing and allow individuals with various hand sizes to use the same exoskeleton effectively. Flex sensors placed over the actuated joints along with position and force sensors on the robot’s linear actuators enable closed-loop control.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose— To improve the accuracy of early postonset prediction of motor recovery in the flaccid hemiplegic arm, the effects of change in motor function over time on the accuracy of prediction were evaluated, and a prediction model for the probability of regaining dexterity at 6 months was developed.Methods— In 102 stroke patients, dexterity and paresis were measured with the Action Research Arm Test, Motricity Index, and Fugl-Meyer motor evaluation. For model development, 23 candidate determinants were selected. Logistic regression analysis was used for prognostic factors and model development.Results— At 6 months, some dexterity in the paretic arm was found in 38\%, and complete functional recovery was seen in 11.6\% of the patients. Total anterior circulation infarcts, right hemisphere strokes, homonymous hemianopia, visual gaze deficit, visual inattention, and paresis were statistically significant related to a poor arm function. Motricity Index leg scores of at least 25 points in the first week and Fugl-Meyer arm scores of 11 points in the second week increasing to 19 points in the fourth week raised the probability of developing some dexterity (Action Research Arm Test ≥10 points) from 74\% (positive predictive value [PPV], 0.74; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.86) to 94\% (PPV, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.76 to 0.91) at 6 months. No change in probabilities of prediction dexterity was found after 4 weeks.Conclusions— Based on the Fugl-Meyer scores of the flaccid arm, optimal prediction of arm function outcome at 6 months can be made within 4 weeks after onset. Lack of voluntary motor control of the leg in the first week with no emergence of arm synergies at 4 weeks is associated with poor outcome at 6 months.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The combination of smart soft composite structure based shape memory alloy (SMA) and exoskeleton technology has the advantages of light weight, energy saving, and great human-exoskeleton interaction. However, there are no relevant studies on the application of SMA-based soft composite structure (SSCS) in hand exoskeletons. The main difficulty is that directional mechanical properties of SSCS need to comply with fingers movement, and SSCS can deliver enough output torque and displacement to the relevant joints. This paper aims to study the application of SSCS for wearable rehabilitation gloves and explore its bionic driving mechanism. This paper proposes a soft wearable glove (Glove-SSCS) for hand rehabilitation actuated by the SSCS, based on finger force analysis under different drive modes. The Glove-SSCS can support five-finger flexion and extension, weighs only 120 g, and adopts modular design. Each drive module adopts a soft composite structure. And the structure integrates actuation, sensing and execution, including an active layer (SMA spring), a passive layer (manganese steel sheet), a sensing layer (bending sensor) and connection layers. To obtain a high-performance SMA actuators, the performance of SMA materials was tested in terms of temperature and voltage, temperature at the shortest length, pre-tensile length and load. And the human-exoskeleton coupling model of Glove-SSCS is established and analyzed from force and motion. The results show that the Glove-SSCS can realize bidirectional movements of fingers flexion and extension, with ranges of motion are 90–110° and 30–40°, and their cycles are 13–19 s and 11–13 s. During the use of Glove-SSCS, the temperature of gloves is from 25 to 67°C, and the surface temperature of hands is from 32 to 36°C. The temperature of Glove-SSCS can be kept at the lowest temperature of SMA operation without much impact on the human body.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Flexible stretch sensors provide feedback to the system to calculate the tension of the cables attached to the fingers. The control can generate several recognizable levels of force for any hand position since the objects to be picked up can vary in weight and dimension. The glove can generate three levels of force (100, 200 and 300 g) to evaluate more easily the proper functioning. We realized tests on 15 volunteers simulating forces in various order after a quick training. We also asked volunteers about the experience for comfort, global experience and simplicity).

Using the example of a "rehabilitation glove", it is shown that the performance of polypyrrole actuators fall short of that required. In particular, the need to simultaneously produce 5\% actuator strain at a 5 MPa isotonic stress cannot be achieved with the actuators investigated in our laboratories to date. However, significant improvements in the performance under load have been achieved with the use of ionic liquid electrolytes. The use of new materials such as composites of conducting polymers and carbon nanotubes offers the possibility of further improvements in actuator performance.

	abstract = {This paper presents the design and fabrication of a soft pneumatic finger and its application to rehabilitation equipment for assisting patients after a stroke. The soft actuator has multiple air chambers continuously next to each other was fabricated by the casting process. The material of the soft actuator is silicone platinum. For making a soft actuator, we designed the 3D model in CAD software and printed the prototypes with a 3D printing machine. The design of the robotic fingers is from the human finger's mechanism because it has a flexible movement in a small scope. We combined these fingers with a glove by mounting them on the glove, formed a rehabilitation device supporting the after-stroke patients. Because the soft pneumatic robotic glove weighs 140g, it makes it light, comfortable, safe, easy to operate, use, and accessible to all users. Additionally, we can control the force, bending angle, and response time by controlling the air pressure inside the fingers. The results showed that the glove could grasp and hold the objects with a small mass.},

	abstract = {We present a novel soft exoskeleton providing active support for hand closing and opening. The main novelty is a different tendon routing, folded laterally on both sides of the hand, and adding clenching forces when the exoskeleton is activated. It improves the stability of the glove, diminishing slippage and detachment of tendons from the hand palm toward the grasping workspace. The clenching effect is released when the hand is relaxed, thus enhancing the user's comfort. The alternative routing allowed embedding a single actuator on the hand dorsum, resulting more compact with no remote cable transmission. Enhanced adaptation to the hand is introduced by the modular design of the soft polymer open rings. FEM simulations were performed to understand the interaction between soft modules and fingers. Different experiments assessed the desired effect of the proposed routing in terms of stability and deformation of the glove, evaluated the inter-finger compliance for non-cylindrical grasping, and characterized the output grasping force. Experiments with subjects explored the grasping performance of the soft exoskeleton with different hand sizes. A preliminary evaluation with Spinal Cord Injury patients was useful to highlight the strengths and limitations of the device when applied to the target scenario.},

The proposed glove is soft, adjustable, allows unconstrained motion of the wrist, and leaves the palm free for object grasping and manipulation. In the proposed design, both flexion and extension motions of the thumb and three fingers (excluding the little finger) are supported by respective bidirectional actuators. The kinematics of the device were derived and are presented along with an experimental evaluation. The developed glove system is compact and light, with the weights of the wearable part and the whole system being 250 and 340 g, respectively. The maximum pinch force provided by the device was experimentally measured to be 16 N, which gives the proposed device one of the highest power-to-weight ratio among existing portable devices for hand ADL assistance. The usability of the developed device was verified in a series of indoor and outdoor tests. The glove allowed test subjects to hold and manipulate versatile objects with diameters up to 90 mm and weighing 300 g. When powered by a conventional 3000-mAh battery, the glove could operate continuously performing grasping task for 4 h.},

Exo-Glove Poly was developed to use two motors, one for the thumb and the other for the index/middle finger, and an under-actuation mechanism to grasp various objects. In order to realize Exo-Glove Poly, design features and fabrication processes were developed to permit adjustment to different hand sizes, to protect users from injury, to enable ventilation, and to embed Teflon tubes for the wire paths. The mechanical properties of Exo-Glove Poly were verified with a healthy subject through a wrap grasp experiment using a mat-type pressure sensor and an under-actuation performance experiment with a specialized test set-up. Finally, performance of the Exo-Glove Poly for grasping various shapes of object was verified, including objects needing under-actuation.},

	abstract = {Soft robotics is gaining interest in rehabilitation applications, bringing new opportunities to offset the loss of upper limb motor function following neurological, neuromuscular, or traumatic injuries. Unlike conventional rigid robotics, the added softness in linkages or joints promises to make rehabilitation robots compliant, which translates into higher levels of safety, comfort, usability, and portability, opening the door for these rehabilitation technologies to be used in daily life. While several reviews documented the different technical implementations of soft rehabilitation robots, it is essential to discuss the growing clinical evidence on the feasibility and effectiveness of using this technology for rehabilitative and assistive purposes, whether softness brings the expected advantages from the perspective of end users, and how we should proceed in the future of this field. In this perspective article, we present recent clinical evidence on how 13 different upper limb devices were used in both controlled (clinical) and uncontrolled (at home) settings in more than 37 clinical studies. From these findings and our own experience, we derive recommendations for future developers and end users regarding the design, application, and evaluation of soft robotics for upper limb rehabilitation and assistance.},

The actuators were designed to satisfy the anatomical range of motion for each joint. Each digit was sensorized at the tip with an inertial measurement unit sensor in order to track the rotation of the distal end. A pneumatic feedback control system was developed to control the motion of the soft robotic digit in following desired trajectories. The performance of the soft robotic glove and the associated control system were examined on an able-bodied subject during flexion and extension to show the glove's applicability to CPM applications.},

In particular, the use of compliant systems often leads to a trade-off between lightness and material flexibility, and control precision. In this letter, we present a compliant, actuated glove with a control scheme to detectthe user’s motion intent, which is estimated by a machine learning algorithm based on muscle activity. Six healthy study participants used the glove in three assistance conditions during a force reaching task. The results suggest that active assistance from the glove can aid the user, reducing the muscular activity needed to attain a medium-high grasp force, and that closed-loop control of a compliant assistive glove can successfully be implemented by means of a machine learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {Traditional rigid exoskeletons can be challenging to the comfort of wearers and can have large pressure, which can even alter natural hand motion patterns. In this paper, we propose a low-cost soft exoskeleton glove (SExoG) system driven by surface electromyography (sEMG) signals from non-paretic hand for bilateral training. A customization method of geometrical parameters of soft actuators was presented, and their structure was redesigned. Then, the corresponding pressure values of air-pump to generate different angles of actuators were determined to support four hand motions (extension, rest, spherical grip, and fist). A two-step hybrid model combining the neural network and the state exclusion algorithm was proposed to recognize four hand motions via sEMG signals from the healthy limb. Four subjects were recruited to participate in the experiments. The experimental results show that the pressure values for the four hand motions were about −2, 0, 40, and 70 KPa, and the hybrid model can yield a mean accuracy of 98.7\% across four hand motions. It can be concluded that the novel SExoG system can mirror the hand motions of non-paretic hand with good performance.},

	abstract = {Neuroplastic changes in motor cortex is essential for the recovery motor function of patients with neurological diseases. To enlarge neuroplastic change, various movements should be provided to stimulate larger motor cortical area, and because hands occupy the largest area, it is especially important. Many wearable robotic devices have been developed for rehabilitation of the hand, and soft robotic devices in particular have drawn attention for their compact design. However, most soft devices provide simple thumb motions, which flex or extend all joints without assistance of opposition/reposition of the carpometacarpal joint although the importance in producing various grasps. In this study, the design of a cable actuated dexterous (CADEX) glove is proposed. For dexterous motion, the structure and orientation of major finger tendons were replicated with exotendons (actuated cables), and four exotendons were used for the thumb with the path optimized to provide flexion/extension of the thumb and decoupled opposition/reposition of the carpometacarpal with other joints. To provide consistent motion, silicon was used for stable anchoring of exotendons while preventing slippage and reducing deformation. The motion generated by the CADEX glove was experimentally evaluated for a single healthy subject. The result shows that the CADEX glove could flex and extend the finger with various ratios among joints, and the opposition/reposition of carpometacarpal joint of the thumb could be achieved consistently with minimal effect on the other joints. The CADEX glove is expected to help providing various tasks which is expected to enhance the functional recovery of patients with neurological disease.},
